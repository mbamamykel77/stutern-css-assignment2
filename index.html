      <p>
        I am currently enrolled at the stutern software engineering programme
        <br />
        So far i've been able to learn html and basic CSS. <br> CSS makes the
        front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience.
        Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much
        harder to navigate. In addition to layout and format, CSS is responsible
        for font color and more.

        What is Padding? <br />
        The padding property in CSS defines the innermost portion of the box
        model, creating space around an element's content, inside of any defined
        margins and/or borders. Padding values are set using lengths or
        percentages, and cannot accept negative values.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        what is Margin? <br />
        The CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements,
        outside of any defined borders. With CSS, you have full control over the
        margins. There are properties for setting the margin for each side of an
        element (top, right, bottom, and left).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        What is Border? <br />
        The border property is a shorthand syntax in CSS that accepts multiple
        values for drawing a line around the element it is applied to.
